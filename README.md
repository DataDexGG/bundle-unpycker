# Bundle Unpyacker

**Bundle Unpyacker** is a Python tool designed to unpack and extract assets from Unity bundles. It supports extracting textures, meshes, audio files, and other game data—primarily for use with titles like **Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes (SWGOH)**, after manifest data has been mapped by tools like [Bundle-Ceeker](https://github.com/yourname/Bundle-Ceeker).
